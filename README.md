# Bike-Rental-Demand-Forecast
Applied the regression models on the Capital Bike Share (Washington, D.C.) to predict demand for bicycle rentals at any given hour, based on time,weather and the other features.

#### The goal for the project is to build and train a regression model on the Capital Bike Share (Washington, D.C.) Kaggle data set, in order to predict demand for bicycle rentals at any given hour, based on time and weather, e.g.:

“Given the forecasted weather conditions, how many bicycles can we expect to be rented out (city-wide) this Saturday at 2pm?”

- split the data into a training and validation set (or apply cross validation)

- conduct an exploratory data analysis

- train a regression model

- iteratively optimize the model by expanding or selecting features

- regularize the model to avoid overfitting

- calculate a RMSLE for the training and validation set

- upload your code to GitHub
